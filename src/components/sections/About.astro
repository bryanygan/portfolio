        I thrive at the intersection of logic and creativity, building tools and systems that solve real-world problems.
        <br /><br />
        From developing a command-driven banking system in Java to designing a personalized meal recommendation site with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, my projects reflect a passion for clean code and user-centric design.
        <br /><br />
        I'm also experienced with Git-based workflows and Agile methodologies, thanks to hands-on team collaboration on group projects.
        <br /><br />
        Let’s build something great together.
