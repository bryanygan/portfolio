        I thrive at the intersection of logic and creativity, building tools and systems that solve real-world problems.
        <br /><br />
        I've built solutions across multiple domains: a command-driven banking system in Java, Discord automation bots that streamline community workflows, and a personalized meal recommendation site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These projects showcase my commitment to clean code and thoughtful user experiences.
        <br /><br />
        I'm also experienced with Git-based workflows and Agile methodologies, thanks to hands-on team collaboration on group projects.
        <br /><br />
        Letâ€™s build something great together.
